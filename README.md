# Middlebury Stereo Matching
### The objective of this project is to assess the quality of the disparity maps generated by window matching in computer vision.  

#### A stereo pair of rectified images is used, and the objective is to calculate the disparity for each pixel (x, y) in the image, defined as the one for which a cost C0(x, y, d) is minimal. Two different cost criteria are tested: SSD in a window using Euclidean distance in the CIELAB color space, and a robust error function based on SSD. The results are evaluated quantitatively using the Middlebury benchmark, with RMS error and percent of bad pixels being the metrics used.
#### This is the second implementation assignment of the Computer Vision Fundamentals course in the UFRGS Computer Science graduate program.
